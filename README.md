# katoa

Extension Library for C# with ALL the toys.  This libaray was inspired by doing Advent of Code ( https://adventofcode.com/ ) and discovering that a lot of little utility methods that are available in other languages aren't in C#. None of the methods are too hard to implement but it would be much nicer if they were available to you straight away.


## Todo

This is very much a work in process at the moment.  The goal at the moment is to harvest as many little utility functions as possible from real code.

Keep in mind 

- These have not had a lot of consideration on whether these functions are a "good idea"
- The testing is not too thorough but everything has a test
- The function names and form may require a bit of refining
- Performance has not been a primary goal
- There is almost no documentation.  However this will be once the library is more stable
